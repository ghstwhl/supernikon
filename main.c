/*
This project transmits a bunch of TV POWER codes, one right after the other, 
with a pause in between each.  (To have a visible indication that it is 
transmitting, it also pulses a visible LED once each time a POWER code is 
transmitted.)  That is all TV-B-Gone does.  The tricky part of TV-B-Gone 
was collecting all of the POWER codes, and getting rid of the duplicates and 
near-duplicates (because if there is a duplicate, then one POWER code will 
turn a TV off, and the duplicate will turn it on again (which we certainly 
do not want).  I have compiled the top-40 most popular codes with the 
duplicates eliminated, both for North America (which is the same as Asia, as 
far as POWER codes are concerned -- even though much of Asia USES PAL video) 
and for Europe (which works for Australia, New Zealand, the Middle East, and 
other parts of the world that use PAL video).

Before creating a TV-B-Gone Kit, I originally started this project by hacking 
the MiniPOV kit.  This presents a limitation, based on the size of
the Atmel ATtiny2313 internal flash memory, which is 2KB.  With 2KB we can only 
fit about 7 POWER codes into the firmware's database of POWER codes.  40 codes
requires 8KB of flash memory, which is why we chose the ATtiny85 for the 
TV-B-Gone Kit.

This version of the firmware has the most popular 40 POWER codes for North America.

/*
The hardware for this project is very simple:
     ATtiny85 has 8 pins:
       pin 1   connects to programming circuitry
       pin 2   one pin of ceramic resonator
       pin 3   one pin of ceramic resonator
       pin 4   ground
       pin 5   PB0 - visible LED, and also connects to programming circuitry
       pin 6   OC1A - IR emitter, through a PN2222A driver (with 47 ohm base resistor), and also connects to programming circuitry
       pin 7   push-button switch, and also connects to serial port programming circuitry
       pin 8   +3v
    See the schematic for more details.

    This firmware requires using an 8.0MHz ceramic resonator 
       (since the internal oscillator may not be accurate enough).

    IMPORTANT:  to use the ceramic resonator, you must perform the following:
                    make burn-fuse_cr

/*
The C compiler creates code that will transfer all constants into RAM when the microcontroller
resets.  Since this firmware has a table (powerCodes) that is too large to transfer into RAM,
the C compiler needs to be told to keep it in program memory space.  This is accomplished by
the macro PROGMEM (this is used in the definition for powerCodes).  Since the
C compiler assumes that constants are in RAM, rather than in program memory, when accessing
powerCodes, we need to use the pgm_read_word() and pgm_read_byte macros, and we need
to use powerCodes as an address.  This is done with PGM_P, defined below.  
For example, when we start a new powerCode, we first point to it with the following statement:
    PGM_P thecode_p = pgm_read_word(powerCodes+i);
The next read from the powerCode is a byte that indicates the carrier frequency, read as follows:
    uint8_t freq = pgm_read_byte(thecode_p);
Subsequent reads from the powerCode are onTime/offTime pairs, which are words, read as follows:
    ontime = pgm_read_word(thecode_p+(offset_into_table);
    offtime = pgm_read_word(thecode_p+(offset_into_table);
